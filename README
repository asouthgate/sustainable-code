This repository houses intentionally broken or flawed code used as a practical exercise for learning software design in research.

Addressing the problems in this repository serves as introduction to:

    - unit testing
    - continuous integration
    - encapsulation
    - code review
    - version control

The following are general problems that can be found in the repository:
    
    - low test coverage
    - tests that do not test
    - poor encapsulation
    - code duplication 
    - oversized functions

Three files are included under the pybroken/ in increasing order of difficulty. Choose one that will provide a challenge.

    1. jacobi.py
    2. phylogeny.py
    3. concurrency.py

The code in each of these files has bugs that result in incorrect outputs. Sometimes when contributing to
a codebase, you will not understand it all. The goal is to encapsulate and test code well enough so that you
can break the relevant parts down into understandable chunks.

See HINTS if required.
