This repository houses intentionally broken or flawed code used as a practical exercise.

The script pyunsustainable/find_tokens.py should search a file for strings that approximately match a query token.
Unfortunately, the application does not work as intended.

### Usage

To attempt to run the code, use:

```
python3 pyunsustainable/find_tokens.py test/example_text_file token
```
